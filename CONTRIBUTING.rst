Contributing
============

There are many ways to contribute to an open-source project, but the two most common are reporting bugs and contributing code.

If you have a bug or issue to report, please visit the `issues page on Github <https://github.com/scolby33/youtube_feeder/issues>`_ and open an issue there.

If you want to make a code contribution, check out the contributing page in the docs for more information.
